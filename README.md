# Risk-Parity-Portfolio
This project implements a Risk Parity Portfolio model using Python to achieve balanced risk contribution across multiple asset classes. The model optimizes capital allocation based on each asset’s volatility and correlation structure, ensuring that no single asset dominates the portfolio’s total risk.
